    <strong>Grading:</strong><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final grade will be determined from the following breakdown:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignments/Discussions &nbsp; 20%<br>

    <strong>Assignments</strong><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignments are typically exercises or small programs that deal with<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementing a specific aspect within web development. The due date of all<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assignments will be announced when they are assigned. Late assignments will be<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given a 20% penalty for each day it is late. After 5 days, no credit will be given.

    <strong>Discussions</strong><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most weeks will feature a discussion topic based on the reading for the term
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Quizzes</strong><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weekly quizzes will be administered in order to reinforce the information that<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was covered for the week.

    <strong>Tests</strong><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a mid-term and a final both of which will either be “take-home”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tests or administered through Canvas. “Take-home” tests will then be<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demonstrated to the instructor for evaluation.

    <strong>Cheating</strong><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Academic dishonesty is defined as cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grades under false pretenses. Plagiarism is defined as submitting the language,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ideas, thoughts or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion. Cheating is defined<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as, but not limited to: obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other materials; obtaining or providing unauthorized information concerning all or<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;part of an examination prior to that examination; taking an examination for<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another student or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;altering test answers after submittal for grading; changing grades after grades<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been awarded; or altering other official academic records.
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All academic dishonesty cases will be reported to the Vice President for Student<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affairs
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Use of AI</strong><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage the use of AI as a learning tool. We will be using it to quickly build<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up various environments, but upon doing so, I expect you to understand what it<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has done. If you do not understand something that AI has built for you, I<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encourage you to ask me, or AI, for clarification. Discussion posts should be<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based on your own knowledge and in your own words.
  </p>
  <p></p>

    <strong>Miscellaneous Info:</strong><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a physical, learning, sensory or psychological disability and require<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accommodations, please let me know as soon as possible. You will need to<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;register with and, in most cases, provide documentation of your disability to<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disability Services. This can be done online through the Accommodations tile in<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TECHweb, or by going directly to https://bachelor.accessiblelearning.com/OIT
